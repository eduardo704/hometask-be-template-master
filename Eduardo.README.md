# Considerations

Hey Everyone like most people I didn't have much time, I tried focusing on having a good architecture and easy to understand code at the same time meeting all the requirements for each endpoint.

I did some unit tests but didn't have time to do for all usecases which contain most of the business logic.

Also has been a while I worked with pure js so if I had a bit more time I would like to search a bit more for some better error handling. For example I like to use some maybe or either monad for that in ts.

Hope you like the project, Cheers Eduardo.
